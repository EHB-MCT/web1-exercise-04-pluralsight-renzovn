    <h2>
      Where teams build better <br />
      technology skills, faster
    </h2>
    <p>
      Technology teams are only as successful as their skills are relevant.
      <br />Give them access to Pluralsight Skillsâ€”courses, assessments,
      learning paths, and labs <br />and you give them the tech fluency they
      need to build business-critical skills.
